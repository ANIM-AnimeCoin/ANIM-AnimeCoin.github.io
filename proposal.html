                            <p>AnimeCash is a re-launch and fork of ANI, a crypto-currency that was first <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423339">launched</a> in January of 2014 and which currently trades on the Cryptopia and Yobit exchanges. The new forked coin, which will trade under the symbol ANIME, will be air-dropped to owners of ANI on the fork snapshot date, which is currently scheduled to take place on May 30<sup>th</sup>, 2018.</p>

                            <p>The original goal of ANI was to serve as a currency for the anime community, for artists and collectors of anime art. Unfortunately, the blockchain technology available at the time didn't allow for much more than another clone of bitcoin. Now, 4 years later, the technology exists to make a secure, decentralized crypto-currency that has the functionality built in at the protocol level to allow for a revolution in the way digital anime art is created and collected:</p>

                            <b>For Anime Fans and Art Collectors:</b>
                            <p>At this point, a collector of anime art can see the art available for sale on the decentralized exchange and can purchase them in return for ANIME coins, which he can buy on Cryptopia or get through mining or from running a Masternode. The collector can see preview images of all the art available on the system, but can only access the original high-resolution image for the artwork that he owns in his Animecoin wallet.</p>

                            <p>At this point, a common objection is "Why would anyone buy an art image if they could see the preview image of it for free?"</p>
                            <p>To see the difference, consider the case of a rare comic book-say, the first comic book featuring Spiderman, which is worth over $100,000 today. It is easy to download a PDF file of the comic book, but no one would claim that this PDF file is valuable, and that's because the PDF is not <i>rare</i></p>
                            <p>Anyone can make as many copies of the PDF as they want for free, while the actual Spiderman comic book can be verified by an expert as being authentic, and since there are just a handful of these issues still in existence that are in good condition, and there are thousands of dedicated comic book collectors in the world, the market forces of supply and demand create the conditions for maintaining a very high price.</p>
                            <p>That's a big part of the innovation of Animecoin: you don't have to wait 50+ years for the art to become rare like in the case of the Spiderman comic book; you can make a rare asset today that cannot be faked and which anyone--not just an art expert who is good as spotting counterfeits--can verify as being authentic using the open-source Animecoin wallet software.</p>
                            <p>Importantly, this entire process is done without any central part acting as the broker or exchange; the Animecoin wallet is built on top of the Counterparty protocol, which takes care of secure <a href="https://www.escrow.com/what-is-escrow">escrow<span style='text-decoration:
                                    none'> </span></a>at the protocol level, so both the buyer and seller are protected and don't need to trust each other.</p>
                            <p>Continuing the previous example, if a collector saw that art image for sale and liked it, he could place an order using the Animecoin wallet app to purchase it for 10,000 ANIME. Since that price matches the selling price specified by the artist, their orders would match, and the artist would get the 10,000 ANIME and the collector would get the art asset. Because these trades take place on the public Animecoin blockchain, everyone can see the price and the ANIME addresses of the buyer and seller (artists and collectors can remain anonymous if they want, or they can use their real identities and secure these by signing their transactions with their digital signature.)</p>
                            <p>At this point, the collector now owns their art and can hold it long-term as a collectible, similar to how he might buy a poster or figurine of an anime character. But unlike a poster, whenever the collector wants, he can list the art asset for sale on the decentralized exchange--maybe for 15,000 ANIME now, if that artwork has become more desirable, or he can send it to his friend as a gift.</p>
                            <p>Think about it: the collector has supported an artist who was making work that he appreciated, and all of the money went straight to the artist, with no commissions or fees to a middle-man. Also, the collector now has a piece of art that is truly, verifiably rare. If the artist specified that a particular art asset should be issued with a quantity of 100, then everyone can trust and rely on this limitation forever--it can't be changed, just like a bitcoin transaction can't be reverse later on for any reason.</p>
                            <p>As a result, if the system grows in popularity, and thousands of people are interested in purchasing a piece of art for which only 100 copies exist, then it's not hard to see how the price of that artwork could increase, say from 10,000 ANIME to 20,000 ANIME. And unlike most collectibles today, such as comic books or Pokemon cards, where when you try to sell them back to the store you are lucky to get back 10% of what you paid, a collector of art assets on the Animecoin blockchain will be able to sell their art assets directly to other collectors without giving up most of the value to a middle-man!</p>

                            <b>For Crypto-Currency Investors:</b>
                            <p>Although the developers of Animecoin have gone to great lengths to make the system easy to understand and use, so that artists who are not very tech-savvy can still use and benefit from the platform, the technology that makes it all possible is sophisticated and represents an innovation in crypto-currency design and functionality.</p>
                            <p>From a crypto-currency perspective, the new ANIME is a combination of some proven technologies:</p>
                            <p>The core of the coin is built on top of a fork of the latest version of Zcash, giving a stable and well-tested proof-of-work backbone that combines the essentially characteristics of Bitcoin with several improvements:</p>
                            <p>A faster 2.5 minute block time, and a larger block size, which will help avoid some of the scaling issues that have become issues as Bitcoin use has grown rapidly.</p>
                            <p>Shielded transactions using Z-SNARK technology, preserving the security of sender and receiver while maintaining all the integrity of a public ledger.
                            </p>

                            <b>Because ANIME is a fork of ANI, there are some specific
                                    considerations that investors should understand:</b>
                            <p>There are currently 2.043 billion ANI coins in existence, and new ANI are mined at the rate of approximately 8 million ANI per year (an annualized inflation rate of 0.39% per year), with no cap on the total number of ANI.</p>
                            <p>While almost all of the existing ANI coins <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=423339">were mined</a> in the initial 6-months of 2014, it is important to note that there was zero pre-mine for Animecoin, and these initial coins were fairly distributed to miners who contributed to the security of the network through proof-of-work.</p>
                            <p>This honest initial distribution is the reason why Animecoin continues to be decentralized, with the current development team controlling under 10% of the total ANI coins in circulation. </p>
                            <p>We plan on continuing this tradition of fair-dealing, with ZERO pre-mine for the new ANIME; all costs surrounding project development, marketing, and exchange fees are being covered by the developers out-of-pocket. Eventually, our goal is to establish and endow a non-profit foundation to assist with the long-term funding for the project's continued development, while maintaining as much decentralization as possible. </p>
                            <p>After observing the recent struggles of other crypto projects that did not provide for adequate funding for development and marketing (particularly exchange listing fees), the ANIME development team has concluded that it is in the best long-term interests of the project to have a Treasury fund that will receive 5% of the ANIME mining block reward in perpetuity.
                            </p>
                            <p>While the treasury fund will initially be implemented as a multi-sig wallet owned by the primary development team, this situation will continue only for as long as it takes to for the developers to be repaid all documented, out-of-pocket expenses associated with the development and promotion of the project with 10% interest, compounded monthly. The developers intend that, once the initial startup costs are repaid with interest, the treasury fund income will be transferred to the masternodes and stakeholders of the ANIME network in a truly decentralized way, so that the funds can be directed to projects and recipients that the community votes for securely using their ANIME wallet. At least 50% of the future treasury fund income is expected to be directly re-invested in the ANIME network through the purchase of ANIME art assets and through the distribution of philanthropic grants to artists selected by the community.
                            </p>

                            <b>Coin Facts:</b>
                            <p> The new ANIME will have a max supply set at 21 billion ANIME coins. </p>
                            <p> On "day one" of the fork, half of this max supply, or 10.5 billion ANIME, will be distributed to holders of ANI, for a ratio of approximately 5.1 ANIME received for every 1 ANI held on the fork snapshot date, which the developers currently plan on happening at the end of May of 2018. </p>
                            <p> After the initial distribution of ANIME on the fork date, the future growth in the supply of ANIME will closely follow the distribution schedule of Bitcoin, adjusted for the max coin supply and the faster block time. </p>
                            <p> For example, the BTC block reward began at 50 BTC per block, with a new block every 10 minutes. Because the ANIME max supply is 1,000x the size of the BTC max supply, we must multiply this by 1,000, but since there is a new ANIME block every 2.5 minutes instead of every 10 minutes for BTC, we must divide by 4; this implies an initial block reward of (50*1,000)/4, or 12,500 ANIME per block. This block reward would be reduced by 50% every 4 years, similar to how it works in Bitcoin. </p>
                            <p> The innovation of the new Animecoin project is that we are combining Zcash with the following features and functionality: </p>
                            <p> A Masternode system derived from DASH, but with major changes and improvements to the way Masternodes are compensated and audited by their peers, which will make the system more secure and decentralized. </p>
                            <p> Masternodes in the ANIME network will do a lot more work than in other Masternode coins: they are responsible not only for verifying transactions on the Animecoin network, but also for validating, storing, and retrieving Animecoin art assets. </p>
                            <p> The initial coin requirement for a Masternode will be set at 10 million ANIME. Masternode owners will receive their pro-rata share of <u>20%</u> of the mining block reward and will also receive their share of any art registration fees. </p>
                            <p> In addition, Masternodes will have a special privilege in the Animecoin network: only they will be allowed to produce unique, one-of-a-kind art assets; all other users of the Animecoin system must create a minimum quantity of 10 pieces for their art assets. Each Masternode will be able to generate approximately four of these unique art assets per year, which presumably will become more valuable because of their extreme scarcity.</p>
                            <p>Importantly, and unlike the vast majority of Masternode coins on the market, the financial interests of Masternode owners will not be placed above the security of the ANIME blockchain, and the ANIME blockchain will award 75% of the mining block rewards to the miners that maintain the security of the network, with 20% going to owners of ANIME masternodes, and the remaining 5% to go to a treasury fund to support the development and marketing of the project, and in particular to help cover the considerable cost of exchange listings. (In comparison, DASH gives just 45% of the block reward to miners).</p>
                            <p> The asset creation and decentralized trading functionality of the
                                <a href="https://counterparty.io/platform/">Counterparty protocol</a>. Note that this is different from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/counterparty/">XCP</a> tokens, which are built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Animecoin project is only taking the <i>code</i> from Counterparty, and instead of building a separate protocol layer on top of ANIME like XCP is built on top of BTC, the functionality of Counterparty is embedded in the ANIME coin protocol itself.</p>
                            <p> An all-new file storage layer that will be run by the Masternodes for storing the art images that combines several break-through technologies to create a robust and fault-tolerant system that will protect the art assets for the long-term, even without requiring a centrally coordinated server. Our system combines the Kademlia Distributed Hash Table algorithm with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luby_transform_code">LT-Codes</a>, all with end-to-end encryption using the Signal protocol.</p>
                            <p>While the specifics are complicated, the basic idea is that when a new art image is registered on the Animecoin network, a group of Masternodes are randomly selected by the network to process the file, breaking it up into thousands of redundant chunks, which are then redundantly spread out to all the Masternodes in the network. </p>
                            <p>A file can be reconstructed by assembling enough of these blocks, and 3 times more of these blocks are stored than are needed to reconstruct the original image files, so that even if many blocks are lost in the future, the images will always be safe. This means that there are two layers of defense against data loss: one is that the chunks of the file are redundant, so that you can lose some of the chunks; the other is that each chunk is stored on multiple different Masternode machines, so it is unlikely that you will lose chunks in the first place. </p>
                            <p>This is made possible by the fact that LT-Codes are a kind of <a href="https://github.com/dbieber/fountaincode">Fountain Code</a>, which means that every chunk of the file is like a droplet of water from a fountain: you just put your cup in and fill it up with droplets, you don't care about which droplet is which. This avoids the frustrating issue that BitTorrent suffers from, where a few specific chunks of the file are missing from the BitTorrent swarm, and so no one can retrieve the entire file until a peer joins the swarm with that particular chunk. </p>
                            <p>ANIME is not just a solid crypto-currency that is built on top of proven and reliable technologies. It is also one of the few examples of a blockchain with a real-world use case, where the technology will enable useful economic activity that might otherwise not happen.</p>

                <h5><p style='font-size:20px;color:#337ab7'><b><u>Future Roadmap:</u></b></p></h5>
                <p><b>As mentioned above, the new ANIME will have various features that will be particularly appealing to the community of anime fans.</b></p>
                <p>Users of the ANIME network will be able to register their original artwork (either made by them or commissioned by them) on the ANIME system. Artists can easily specify a folder on their computer containing one or more image files that constitute a particular piece of art, which are added to a single zip file for that art. The artist will then pay a one-time registration fee, denominated in ANIME and paid to the Masternodes in return for the Masternodes securely and redundantly storing the image files "forever". The innovative storage technology layer that we have developed for ANIME allows us to have a distributed file system that can survive even catostrophic data loss. In fact, we designed our system so that over 75% of the block files used to reconstruct the art files can be lost through Masternodes disconnecting or through data loss/corruption, and we are still guaranteed to be able to reconstruct the original file. Users can then specify, using an easy-to-understand, slick web interface, the details of their new art asset:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The <b>name</b> of the asset; for example, Faye_Valentine_&le;3</li>
                        <li>The quantity of the asset, a whole number greater than 4 and less than or equal 10,000)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Suppose Akira from our earlier example wants to issue a particular <b>Faye_Valentine_&lt;3</b> asset using the following image, which is an 883kb PNG image:
        </div>
        <div class='col-md-7'>
            <p>He will use the new ANIME web-wallet to specify the meta-data (asset name and quantity) as well as a link to the image file. The image file will be stored in a decentralized, trustless way which will ensure that ANIME never suffers from dead links and missing images.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='col-md-5'> <img height='80%' width='80%' src='images/image1.png' /> </div>
        <div class='col-md-12'>
            <p>Continuing our example, Akira would also specify the <b>quantity</b> of his asset. In this case, suppose he creates 1,000 of this Faye_Valentine_ &lt;3.</p>
            <p><b>Here's where it gets really cool: Akira can also list his</b> Faye_Valentine_
                <3 asset on the ANIME decentralized exchange!</p>
                    <p>But not just any ANIME asset can be listed on the exchange; there will be stricter requirements for listed assets:</p>
                    <p><b>Each unique image (and this includes copies of the same image in different resolutions or with minor changes) can only be used 
                        <i>once</i> for a single listed ANIME asset.</b> This will be automatically enforced by using standard machine learning based image similarity algorithms (for example, see <a href='http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596503001541'>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0923596503001541</a> or
                        <a href='http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8120017/?reload=true'>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8120017/?reload=true</a> ) that will compare a digital fingerprint of each submitted image file to a database of fingerprints already used for assets on the ANIME blockchain (this database itself will be stored on the ANIME Masternodes, making the system robust, decentralized, and trustless).</p>
                    <p><b>This image similarity algorithm, which is computationally intensive, will only be run by ANIME masternodes</b>, and is one of the major services they provide to the ANIME network in order to justify taking 20% of the mining block reward. Out of all the ANIM masternodes, 10 will be selected at random (using a random seed generated by taking the hash of the most recent ANIM block) to validate a newly requested image so that the network can check if it is allowed to be listed on the decentalized ANIM exchange (this will be similar to <a href='https://rarepepewallet.com/'>rarepepewallet.com</a> and <a href='http://counterwallet.io/'>counterwallet.io</a>). Again, an image will considered valid if it is not a copy (or very similar to) any image that has already been used for a listed ANIME asset on the exchange.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class='row'>
        <div class='col-md-8'>
            <p>The next week, another user, Gatsu, could also issue a listed asset using a different image of the same character, say this one:</p>
            <p>However, Gatsu would have to choose a different name for his asset because ANIME asset names are unique. For example, Gatsu could call his asset "❤Faye❤".</p>
            <p>Returning to our example, if more than 7 of the 10 randomly selected masternodes agree that the image is valid, then it is accepted onto the exhange for trading with other ANIME users in a trustless way. Akira can set whatever price he wants for his 1,000 Faye_Valentine_
                <3 assets. If he sets a high price for his art (say, 500,000 ANIME each) then he might struggle to entice buyers. Or he could set a low price, , in which case he might quickly sell 75 of his Faye_Valentine_<3 assets, leaving him with 925 that he might set at a higher price later. It 's all
                          up to him to decide. He can either maximize his profit or try to distribute he art as widely as possible.</p>

        <div class='row '>
            <div class='col-md-12 '>
                <p>In this way, the ANIME network and blockchain will enable the creation of genuinely RARE anime assets that can be traded with others for ANIME coins without 
                    requiring a trusted 3rd party, like <a href='# '>bittrex.com</a></p>							
                <p>But "regular" ANIME assets listed on the exchange are only somewhat rare, because each one will have a quantity of at least 5.</p>
                <p><b><u>To create truly unique, one-of-a-kind assets (called a "Waifu Asset"), a user will have to run an ANIME Masternode.</u></b></p>
            </div>

	   <br/>

        <div class='row '>

                <h5><p style='font-size:20px;color:#337ab7 '><b><u>Masternodes:</u></b></p></h5>
                <p>In order to to run an ANIME masternode, a user will need to send 10 million ANIME coins to an address in their own ANIME wallet in a single transaction.</p>
                <p>The number of required ANIME is intentionally set high enough so that there aren't a huge number of masternodes; we need to have some masternodes to keep the network working well, but this number is probably closer to 200 masternodes rather than 10,000 of them (on the other hand, ANIME needs as much mining hash power as it can get, since this is what makes the currency secure and scarce!).</p>
                    <p>Similar to other masternode coins, users can run as many masternodes as they desire; the only requirement is that they own 10 million ANIME for each masternode they want to run.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <b>Masternodes receive a number of special perks and benefits in the ANIME network:</b>
                    <ol>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Masternodes operators split among themselves 20% of the total future ANIME mining block rewards that are paid out; whatever that 20% of the block reward amounts to for a given block will be divided by the number of active masternodes, and each masternode will receive their share of the amount at the same time block rewards are paid to miners of ANIM. Note that only active ANIM masternodes participate in the 20% block reward: to be considered active, a masternode must maintain a certain uptime percentage where it is responsive to pings from other ANIME masternodes, and the masternode must also participate in the duplicate image detection process when it is called upon to do so in the randomized selection process. To make sure that a masternode isn't "cheating" by not actually running the CPU intensive processes (of which the duplicate image detection is the major example), their responses will be compared to the other randomly selected Masternodes, and if it is in the minority (say, the other 9 images report a new image as being invalid, but one masternode says it is valid), that masternode that disagrees will be skipped over for the next 10 of the 5% block reward payouts.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li>Masternodes operators have the special power to issue unique one-of-a-kind ANIME assets that are tied to a specific anime character; these will be known as Waifu Assets. Each ANIME masternode will be allowed to generate a new Waifu asset 4 times a year, which will be implemented in the code by counting the number of ANIME blocks. Since ANIME will have a 2.5 minute average block creation interval, we can calculate the number of blocks that must be added to the ANIM blockchain since the last block in which the mastenode generated a Waifu Asset:</li>
                    </ol>
                    <center>
                        <p>Days between Waifu Issuance: 91.31</p>
                        <p>Average Block Creation Time in Minutes: 2.5</p>
                        <p>ANIM Blocks Generated per Day: 576</p>
                        <p><b>Required Blocks between Waifu Issuance: 52,595</b></p>
                    </center>
                    <p>Waifu Assets are automatically allowed to be listed on the exchange after they are created by a masternode, but the creation process will be much stricter than for regular ANIME assets:</p>
                    <p>Before a new Waifu asset is permited to be created with a given image file, all of the other masternodes will be given a period of 1,000 ANIM blocks to vote on whether to allow the requested Waifu. Unlike the restriction on duplicate/similar images, which can be regulated using a fully automatic algorithm that doesn't require human intervention, the rule for Waifus is that <b><u>only one Waifu is
                     permitted per unique anime character</u></b>. Since an image of the Faye Valentine character could look lots of different ways depending on the artist and style/outfit/etc., this part requires a different procedure to implement, which is why the decision will be made by majority vote of the other masternodes.</p>
                    <p>Proposed Waifus will have to specify the unique character they want using the ANIME web wallet, where you will be required to specify the exact character desired by providing the URL corresponding to that character on www.animecharacterdatabase.</p>
                    <p>Suppose Akira really likes Faye and wants to make her his Waifu. As long as no other masternode has already selected Faye, and assuming that the required number of ANIM blocks has elapsed since Akira last generated a Waifu, Akira will paste the following link into the Waifu form in his ANIM web wallet:<b><center><a href='https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/characters.php?id=16238'>https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/characters.php?id=16238</a></center></b></p>
                    <p>The other masternodes will then check their distributed database of used Waifu character URLs, and if the Faye URL does not appear in the list of used URLs, then Akira is free to issue his Faye Waifu, and the Faye URL is added to the list to prevent someone else from registering another Faye.</p>
                    <p>Waifu names will be required to match the name field in the animecharactersdatabase.com site (but with spaces replace with the "_" character), and all such names will be reserved for Waifus at the launch of the network. This is to prevent "cyber-squatting," where a user creates a normal, non-Waifu, ANIM asset and names it Faye_Valentine Because of the required uniqueness of ANIM asset names, this would conflict with the Waifu name, creating confusion.</p>
                    <p>What is the point of all this? By allowing only Waifu Assets to be unique, the ANIME network creates true scarcity. If Akira is a huge Faye fan, he will want to own the Faye Waifu even if it costs a lot of ANIME to buy it! Alternatively, Akira may see that no one has registered the Faye Waifu asset yet, and he will rush to set up his ANIME masternode so that he can issue the Waifu himself.</p> <b><u><p>This generates demand for ANIME, since it will cost a 10 million ANIME to make a masternode.
                         And we all know how possesive anime fans are about their favorite characters!</p></u></b>
                    <p>But if ANIME takes off and is a success, the money Akira spends on buying the ANIME required to make his masternode so he can issue his Faye Waifu may prove to be a great investment. Why? Suppose Gatsu learns about ANIME 6 months after Akira, and Gatsu is not only a huge Faye fan, but Gatsu is also rich (suppose he bought BTC in 2010!). Then Gatsu can use the decentralized exchange to make an offer to Akira to purchase his Faye Waifu for 250,000 ANIME coins. Akira can decide that he doens't care about the money and doesn't want to lose his Faye Waifu, or he can decide to take the money and sell the Faye Waifu to Gatsu and take the ANIME coins in payment.</p>

                    <p>Note that Gatsu does not have to run a masternode to purchase Faye Waifu, he just needs a masternode to issue the Waifu originally. Assuming Gatsu does buy the Faye Waifu from Akira, this transaction will be recorded in the ANIME blockchain (just like all ANIME? asset traded on the decentralized exchange). Once the Faye Waifu is safely stored in Gatsu's ANIME wallet and confirmed by a certain number of nodes as being valid, Gatsu will be able to submit another image of Faye if he prefers; this image will be required to be approved by at least 50 other ANIME masternodes over a 1,000 block period; the reason for this is to prevent trolling, where a user maliciously tries to change the image file for the Faye Waifu asset to be something offensive.</p>
                    <p>This collectability aspect of ANIME assets is what makes the project interesting and special. It is only though the power of the decentralized blockchain that such rareness can be created in a fair, transparent way that can't be gamed or manipulated.</p>
                    Once ANIME coins reach some threshold of value, say a market cap of over $100 million, there is no reason why ANIME coins can't serve as a perfectly good general crypto-currency. Sure, they will have this extra functionality for trading and issuing ANIME assets, but they are also a provably scarce, fairly mined, PoW crypto currency with all the same characteristics that made Bitcoin so valuable.</p>
            <p>That is to say, ANIME could eventually transcend its origins as an Anime related project and be used for other things; for example, as a generic crypto currency for creating provably rare digital art of any kind that can be traded in a decentralized exchange. Stranger things have happned: recall that Mt Gox began as a Magic the Gathering website!</p>
